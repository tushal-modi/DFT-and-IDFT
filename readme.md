# DFT and IDFT computation using C++

- Simulated a naïve algorithm for computation of DFT and IDFT using C++

---------------------

It is possible to import libraries (in the case of C++) where one might have a problem with ensuring code legibility when it comes to writing this expression. However, a little mathematical insight and a simple conversion is the perfect requirement here. Many would agree. Note that this gives rise to imaginary and real parts of the expression – cosine terms are real and sine terms are all imaginary. A rather intuitive perspective may be implemented as well – express the sequences as matrices and use the vector form of DFT and IDFT for calculations. This is best worked out in MATLAB.
